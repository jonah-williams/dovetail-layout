# A dovetail layout tool

## The problem

Dovetails provide a strong and attractive joint but they present the woodworker with a number of decisions which will dictact the appearance of the final joint. How many pins and tails should they use, how large should they be, how should they be spaced over the length of the joint?

## The app

I wanted a quick way to preview diffent joint layouts before committing to a design so I built a little app here which allows you to specify the dimensions and configuration of a joint and render a preview of the resulting piece to check your proportions.

## Implementation details
This project was remixed from my [glitch-create-react-redux-app](https://glitch.com/~glitch-create-react-redux-app) which provided a template React/Redux app.

I built this as an excuse to experiment with a couple of tools:
* Using Glitch.com as an editor/hosting/collaboration environment.
* Getting more practice setting up a React and Redux app from scratch and the decisions available during that process.
* Three.js for WebGL rendering and the data flow patterns to drive a 3D model/viewport.
